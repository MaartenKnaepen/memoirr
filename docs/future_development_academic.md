### **Memoirr: Comprehensive RAG Performance Improvement Analysis**

This document provides an exhaustive technical analysis of all possible approaches to improve RAG retrieval quality, organized by theoretical impact and implementation complexity. Each approach is evaluated based on academic literature and state-of-the-art research.

## **Current System Limitations**

The existing RAG pipeline suffers from several well-documented issues in information retrieval:
- **Dense retrieval limitations**: Single vector representations lose fine-grained lexical information
- **Semantic gap**: Query-document mismatch in embedding space
- **Lack of hierarchical understanding**: No distinction between content types or importance levels
- **Missing speaker attribution**: Critical metadata for dialogue-heavy content
- **Monolithic retrieval**: Single-stage pipeline without iterative refinement
