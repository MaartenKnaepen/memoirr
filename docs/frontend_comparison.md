## Technology Overview

### Streamlit
**Best for:** Internal tools, data apps, and rapid prototyping with rich widget ecosystem.

**Pros:**
- Natural for ML/data science interfaces
- Rich widget ecosystem with chat interface, file uploads, sidebars
- Session state management for conversation history
- Great documentation and community support
- Flexible deployment options

**Cons:**
- Page reloads can feel less smooth
- CSS customization is possible but clunky
- Can be slow with large datasets
- Session state complexity with complex flows

### Gradio
**Best for:** Model demos, quick prototypes, and sharing with external users.

**Pros:**
- ML-focused with minimal boilerplate
- Built-in chat interface (`gr.ChatInterface()`)
- Zero-config sharing with automatic public URLs
- Perfect for model demonstrations
- Built-in request queuing for heavy models

**Cons:**
- Limited customization beyond basic styling
- More rigid component arrangement
- Fewer widgets compared to Streamlit
- Less sophisticated state management

### Reflex (Pynecone)

- Flexible CSS-in-Python styling
- Real-time features with WebSockets
- Full Python type hints support

**Cons:**
- Newer framework with smaller community
- Different paradigm requiring learning curve
- More complex build and deployment process
- Still evolving documentation

### TypeScript Frontend (React/Vue/Angular)
**Best for:** Production applications requiring maximum flexibility and professional UI/UX.

**Pros:**
- Unlimited customization possibilities
- Excellent performance and user experience
- Professional-grade UI/UX capabilities
- Sophisticated state management options
- Large ecosystem and community

**Cons:**
- Significant time investment for setup and development
- Steep learning curve if not familiar with frontend development
- Higher maintenance overhead
- Slower iteration speed

## Recommendations

### For MVP/Quick Demo
**Gradio** - Get a working chat interface in 15 minutes with minimal code.

### For Internal Tools
**Streamlit** - Rich feature set with good balance of simplicity and functionality.
