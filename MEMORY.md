# Implementation Memory

## Phase 1: Foundation

### Step 1.1: Configuration Updates (Completed)
Added V1 multimodal configuration settings to `src/core/config.py` including metadata API settings (TMDB, Radarr, Plex), vision pipeline settings (scene detection, face recognition, VLM model configuration), and speaker tagging settings. Updated `pyproject.toml` with new dependencies (scenedetect, opencv-python, qwen-vl-utils, guessit, pillow, accelerate, requests). Created `.env.example` template and comprehensive test suite in `test/core/test_v1_config.py` with 18 passing tests covering defaults and validation.

### Step 1.2: Type Definitions (Completed)
Created frozen dataclasses for V1 Foundation type system. Defined `CastMember` and `MovieMetadata` in `src/components/metadata/utilities/types.py` for movie metadata from TMDB/Radarr/Plex. Defined `FaceDetection`, `FaceCluster`, `VisualDescription`, and `Scene` in `src/components/vision/utilities/types.py` for vision pipeline stages. All types follow immutability pattern with `@dataclass(frozen=True)`, proper type hints, Google-style docstrings, and default factories. Fixed `.gitignore` to track

### Step 1.3: TMDB Client Implementation (Completed)
Implemented `TmdbClient` following the 3-layer architecture pattern. Created `api_request.py` utility for HTTP requests with error handling, rate limiting, and retries. Created `response_parser.py` utility for parsing TMDB JSON responses into frozen dataclasses. Created `orchestrate_tmdb.py` orchestrator for coordinating search and metadata fetching operations. Created `tmdb_client.py` wrapper class that manages API key configuration and provides clean interface methods: `search_movie()`, `get_movie_metadata()`, and `get_movie_metadata_by_id()`. Comprehensive test suite with 34 passing tests covering API requests, response parsing, orchestration, and client wrapper functionality. All tests use proper mocking patterns with `unittest.mock` and `LoggedOperation` mocks. `.env.example`. Created comprehensive test suite in `test/components/test_v1_types.py` with 17 passing tests covering creation, defaults, and immutability. Package structure established with proper `__init__.py` exports for both metadata and vision components.

### Step 1.4: Radarr Client Implementation (Completed)
Implemented `RadarrClient` following the 3-layer architecture pattern. Created `api_request.py` utility for HTTP requests with X-Api-Key authentication, connection error handling (for local Radarr servers), and 401 unauthorized detection. Created `response_parser.py` utility for parsing Radarr JSON responses into `MovieMetadata` objects and extracting file paths from movieFile fields. Created `orchestrate_radarr.py` orchestrator providing `get_all_movies()` and `get_movie_by_tmdb_id()` operations. Created `radarr_client.py` wrapper class with methods: `get_all_movies()`, `get_movie_by_tmdb_id()`, `get_movie_by_radarr_id()`. Configuration loaded from `RADARR_URL` and `RADARR_API_KEY` environment variables (already present in config.py). All tests passing (34 tests: 24 utility tests + 10 component tests). Note: Radarr doesn't provide cast information - use `TmdbClient` to enrich metadata with cast details. Exported `RadarrClient` from `src/components/metadata/__init__.py`.
